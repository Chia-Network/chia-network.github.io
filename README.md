Chia.net
========

Website for the [Chia](https://www.chia.net/) cryptocurrency.

Development
-----------

To set up your environment and run the server locally:

```bash
gem install bundler
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-network.github.io.git
cd chia-network.github.io
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

More detailed instructions available at the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).

### Videos

To ensure videos work in Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge, videos should be encoded as H.264 MP4. For example:

```bash
# use this command to generate the H.264 MP4 version of the video
ffmpeg -i assets/Chia_Launch_original.mp4 -vcodec h264 -acodec aac -strict -2 -movflags +faststart assets/Chia_Launch.mp4 # convert video (in any supported format) into H.264 MP4
```

Then, generate a thumbnail for the video, used as a fallback (when the browser doesn't support video) or shown before the video is loaded:

```bash
# extract frame at 0 hours, 0 minutes, and 15 seconds into the video, save it as a JPG
ffmpeg -ss 00:00:15 -i assets/Chia_Launch.mp4 -vframes 1 -q:v 2 assets/Chia_Launch.jpg
```

Now that you have the H.264 MP4, and the thumbnail JPG, use the following markup in your HTML to include the video (with our cross-browser video component):

```
{% include video.html id="some-unique-identifier-for-video" path="/assets/Chia_Launch.mp4" mimetype="video/mp4" thumbnail="/assets/Chia_Launch.jpg" %}
```

Deployment
----------

Push to a GitHub repository, making sure the repository is set up with `https://www.chia.net` as a [custom domain name](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/).

Content Management
------------------

### SEO

On any page, front matter entries can be used to add social media metadata. For example, on a blog post:

```markdown
# post-specific fields (other fields also may be used in the post, but also are used for SEO)
layout: post
date:   2019-04-04
carousel: true

# also used as title of card preview on Twitter and Facebook
title:  "Chia Network Announces 2nd VDF Competition with $100,000 in Total Prize Money"

# thumbnail image (note: must be a full URL, so it has to start with `https://chia.net/...`)
# note: this defaults to https://chia.net/android-chrome-384x384.png
# note: test this using https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator and https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/sharing/
image: https://chia.net/android-chrome-384x384.png

# description of the current page
# note: this defaults to the first paragraph of the content
description: "This is a blog post on Chia Network's blog."

# content language

Internationalization
--------------------

This website is localized in several languages, each having the same basic structure under their own directories:

* English: `en` (under `./`)
* French: `fr` (under `./fr`)
* Chinese: `cn` (under `./cn`)
* Japanese: `jp` (under `./jp`)
* Dutch: `nl` (under `./nl`)
* German: `de` (under `./de`)
* Spanish: `es` (under `./es`)
* Serbian: `sr` (under `./sr`)
* Portuguese: `pt` (under `./pt`)
* Turkish: `tr` (under `./tr`)

To add a language, let's say Esperanto:

```bash
LANGUAGE="eo" # ISO 639-1 language code
cp -r fr $LANGUAGE
find $LANGUAGE -type f -exec sed -i "s/lang: fr/lang: $LANGUAGE/g" {} \;
```

Now, new strings need to be created in `_data/strings.yml`. This is a YAML file containing language codes, mapped to string identifiers, mapped to translations of each string:

```yaml
SOME_LANGUAGE_CODE:
  SOME_STRING_1_IDENTIFIER: "VALUE OF STRING 1, TRANSLATED INTO SOME_LANGUAGE_CODE"
  SOME_STRING_2_IDENTIFIER: "VALUE OF STRING 2, TRANSLATED INTO SOME_LANGUAGE_CODE"
  ...

SOME_OTHER_LANGUAGE_CODE:
  SOME_STRING_1_IDENTIFIER: "VALUE OF STRING 1, TRANSLATED INTO SOME_OTHER_LANGUAGE_CODE"
  SOME_STRING_2_IDENTIFIER: "VALUE OF STRING 2, TRANSLATED INTO SOME_OTHER_LANGUAGE_CODE"
  ...
```

Then, let Jekyll know about this new language by editing `_data/languages.yml`

This may seem inefficient, but GitHub Pages' Jekyll setup currently has no internationalization plugin, so this is currently the simplest way. To minimise code duplication, each file in the language folders is simply a placeholder containing only what it's supposed to represent. For example, the French homepage, `./fr/index.md`, has the following contents:

```
---
layout: homepage
lang: fr
---
```

To internationalize content (e.g., blog posts), we use `lang: SOME_LANGUAGE_CODE` in the YAML front matter to specify which language's site the page should show up on. For example, here's a French FAQ entry, `./collections/_faq/p01-04-what-is-proof-of-space.fr.md`:

```markdown
---
lang: fr
page: 1
order: 4
---

Qu'est-ce qu'une "preuve d'espace"?
-------------------------

La «preuve d'espace» ne doit pas être confondue avec le stockage. [...]
```

To ensure this FAQ entry is available in all languages, make sure you have one `./collections/_faq/p01-04-what-is-proof-of-space.<LANGUAGE_CODE>.md` translated file for every `<LANGUAGE_CODE>`.
