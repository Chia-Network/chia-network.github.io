Bram and I are no real fans of the current patent regime around software for a host of reasons. We, however, are realists about needing patent protection to defend ours and other developers' ability to innovate and use new blockchain related technologies to solve real world problems.

That is why today we are announcing that we have joined the [Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance](https://www.opencrypto.org/). We are pooling our soon to be issued set of patents on Proof of Space and Time and many other aspects of the groundbreaking new Chia blockchain with other industry leaders like Blockstream, Square, Uniswap, and Kraken amongst [others](https://www.opencrypto.org/members/). We wish to ensure that everyone has access to the core inventions that will enable a blockchain driven future.

This is on top of our existing choice and commitment to the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). The Apache License gives freedom to our developers and users to use both our copyrights but, more importantly in this case, our patents unless they attempt to weaponize their patents.

Together with our foundational inventions and the invention library from fellow members of this patent pool, we can ultimately protect innovation and foster new inventions that will stand on our shoulders as we stand on the shoulders of giants.
