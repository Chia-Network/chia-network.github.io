Today we release [version 2.0 of the Chia Business Whitepaper](/assets/Chia-Business-Whitepaper-2022-02-02-v2.0.pdf). Much has changed since the first versions of this document including Chia becoming the largest and most decentralized blockchain by node count ever and being secured by 40+ EB of space. While we were at it we delivered our significant new decentralized pooling functionality and actual decentralized DeFi - just to name a few.

Weâ€™re also finally able to talk about our early adopters like the World Bank and Costa Rica, and are excited to highlight community projects in the Chia ecosystem like Nucle.io, HashGreen, and many more.

Lastly, with our equity fundraise last May and the conversion of all of our SAFEs to equity, much about our cap table is simplified as we had alluded to in version 1 of the Whitepaper.

We will be hosting an AMA Friday February 4, 2022 at 3PM PST especially to answer questions related to the Business Whitepaper - both old and new. Links will be posted here, the [Keybase #announcements](https://keybase.io/team/chia_network.public) channel, and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chia_project) and [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/chia).
