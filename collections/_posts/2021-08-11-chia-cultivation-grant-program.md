**TL;DR** Chia is launching the Chia Cultivation Grant, to invest in independent delveopers who are looking to create new and exciting tools to benefit the Chia ecosystem at large.

Chia Networks is excited to announce the **Chia Cultivation Grant program**. As we are committed to growing and nurturing the Chia ecosystem, we realize that we can't (and shouldn't) do everything ourselves. Not only are we striving to build applications and functionality in-house, but we want to encourage our highly engaged community to unleash its creativity as well. We know that members of the community will create amazing open source projects of their own, and that some of those projects will very likely stand as pillars of the community and ecosystem. To that end, in an effort to further support these high-potential projects and teams, we have created this grant program.

Recipients of this grant are people or teams who have caught the eye of Chiaâ€™s senior leadership and presented a compelling proposal as to why they feel their vision, talent, and expertise are uniquely positioned to add material value to the community, such as Chialisp applications, Wallets, blockchain tools, and other projects. We plan to recognize this potential value by providing to them some modest financial support to help realize their vision, as well as highlighting the potential value Chia feels they bring to the ecosystem with promotional assets and support.

To further support this program we have launched the [Chia Cultivation Grant homepage](https://www.chia.net/grants), which currently reflects a basic outline of the program, but as time goes on will soon also showcase profiles of current recipients of the grant, and FAQ, and more. Until then, watch that space for more updates, and if you have a team with a project vision you think would be a potential candidate for a Grant, you can reach out to us at the contact info posted on that page!
