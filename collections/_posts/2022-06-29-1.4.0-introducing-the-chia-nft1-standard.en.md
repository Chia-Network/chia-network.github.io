Today, we're pleased to announce the launch of the next milestone of our journey: The Chia NFT1 standard on mainnet. Our [NFT0](https://www.chia.net/2022/05/11/our-vision-for-chia-nfts.en.html) testnet release in May outlined our vision for the future of NFTs -- We are seeking to leverage Chia's sustainable, inclusive, and compliant blockchain to enable and drive real-world applications of digital ownership through **true marketplace independence**, **consistent provenance**, and **digital permanence**.

We took a comprehensive and empathy-first approach to understand the ecosystem, the technology's benefits (both realized and unrealized), the challenges, and the pain points. We built our NFT1 standard to offer novel and expanded functionality we believe addresses the friction NFT creators and collectors experience, as well as serve as the foundation to scale the technology into new use cases.

We're also excited to announce [Chia Friendsâ„¢](http://www.chiafriends.xyz/), our PFP NFT collection, which we're giving away to celebrate the launch of the NFT1 standard. It's a fun, free way to engage with Chia NFTs and discover the power of decentralized, zero-counterparty risk trading with Chia Offers. It also demonstrates an important differentiator of Chia NFTs: on-chain royalties, paid out to the NFT creator with every Chia Offer trade. 100% of the proceeds from the on-chain royalties are automatically paid out to [The Marmot Recovery Foundation](https://marmots.org).

_Any NFTs minted by Chia Network will use our official DID: `did:chia:19qf3g9876t0rkq7tfdkc28cxfy424yzanea29rkzylq89kped9hq3q7wd2`. Always check the provenance of an NFT purportedly to be official from us by looking for this DID as the creator!_

Because this is a significant change, we've created and published a lot of documentation and information throughout our ecosystem -- below is a summary of links to docs and materials which may be relevant to you:
