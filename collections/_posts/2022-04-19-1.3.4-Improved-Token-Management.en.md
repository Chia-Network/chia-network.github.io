We've done some remodeling on the GUI, so you'll find that things have moved around. 

We've provided some notes and context (and GIFs!) for you to become familiar with the new GUI, which has incorporated community feedback and is structured to better support future features. Please take a look below to understand what has changed. As always, we welcome your feedback.

# New Features
### Set unit price on Offers

Creating an offer now allows you to edit the exchange between two tokens that will auto calculate either the sending token amount or the receiving token amount.

### Offer makers can add a fee to ensure transactions happen
When making an offer, makers can now create an offer including a fee to help get the transaction into the mempool when an offer is accepted.

### Token management
Token selection has been changed to a permanent column in the GUI instead of the drop-down list.

</p>

Manage token option has been added at the bottom of the Token column to all users to show/hide token wallets.

Users can show/hide token wallets. If you have auto-discover cats in config.yaml turned off, new tokens will still show up there, but those wallets won’t get created until the token has been toggled on for the first time.

CATs now have a link to Taildatabase.com to look up the Asset ID.

### Bug fixes & improvements
* Significant harvester protocol update: You will need to update your farmer and all your harvesters as this is a breaking change in the harvester protocol. The new protocol solves many scaling issues. In particular, the protocol supports sending delta changes to the farmer - so for example, adding plots to a farm results in only the new plots being reported. We recommend you update your farmer first.

* Ongoing improvements to internal test framework for speed and reliability.
