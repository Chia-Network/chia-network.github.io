Security is about making better choices. You can never be 100% secure, but you can always make better choices and be safer. Making better choices is especially important when it comes to protecting things of value, like the XCH in your Chia wallet!

There are two main areas to consider: securing your devices and your security habits

Keep in mind: *Don’t trust anyone.* 

Assume malicious intent and verify things for yourself. Being reasonably paranoid when it comes to crypto is a good mindset. Your goal is to make things harder for the bad guys, and the steps below will help you do that. We're going to briefly go over the basics you need to do and then cover more advanced security practices in more detail.

## The Basics

### Securing Your Devices
* Keep your operating systems up to date
* Keep your router firmware up to date
* Use strong passwords for your computer login and other accounts
* Don't let people use your computer account. Use guest accounts

### Your Habits
* Do not trust anyone. Assume malicious intent, especially on the internet.
* Do not share your 24 word mnemonic key(s) with anyone. 
* When downloading Chia software, make sure you are downloading from the `chia.net` domain. 

##  Beyond the Basics

### Cold Wallets
If your Chia wallet is not accessible electronically, then it becomes incredibly difficult to compromise and steal. We urge you to store your XCH in a *cold wallet*, sometimes known as a hardware wallet or paper wallet. 

In broad strokes: You will create a wallet through a new 24 word mnemonic key on a secured computer not connected to the internet. Store the key in a safe place, like a safe, and not in a computer. You will set your XCH receive address to the wallet address associated with this new mnemonic key.

Some methods of cold wallet storage include:
* writing your key on paper and storing it in a vault
* using a metal wallet, where you press your key into pieces of metal
* hardware wallets that are basically USB drives that store your key
