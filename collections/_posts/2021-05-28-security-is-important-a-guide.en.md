Security is about making better choices. You can never be 100% secure, but you can always make better choices and be safer. Making better choices is especially important when it comes to protecting things of value, like the XCH in your Chia wallet!

There are two main areas to consider: securing your devices and your security habits

Keep in mind: *Donâ€™t trust anyone.* 

Assume malicious intent and verify things for yourself. Being reasonably paranoid when it comes to crypto is a good mindset. Your goal is to make things harder for the bad guys, and the steps below will help you do that. We're going to briefly go over the basics you need to do and then cover more advanced security practices in more detail.

## The Basics

### Securing Your Devices
* Keep your operating systems up to date
* Keep your router firmware up to date
* Use strong passwords for your computer login and other accounts
* Don't let people use your computer account. Use guest accounts

### Your Habits
* Do not trust anyone. Assume malicious intent, especially on the internet.
* Do not share your 24 word mnemonic key(s) with anyone. 
* When downloading Chia software, make sure you are downloading from the `chia.net` domain. 
* Avoid public Wifi, but if you use public Wifi, use a VPN
* Don't become a target: Don't boast about your winnings. Keep it to yourself.

##  Beyond the Basics

### Cold Storage
Your XCH is only as secure as your wallet. 

If your Chia wallet is not accessible electronically, then it becomes incredibly difficult to compromise and steal (basically impossible). We urge you to store your XCH in a *cold wallet*.

In broad strokes: You will create a wallet through a new 24 word mnemonic key on a secured computer not connected to the internet. Store the key in a safe place, like a safe, and not in a computer. You will set your XCH receive address to the wallet address associated with this new mnemonic key.

Some methods of cold wallet storage include:
* writing your key on paper and storing it in a vault
* using a metal wallet, where you press your key into pieces of metal
* hardware wallets that are basically USB drives that store your key

One way of utilizing wallets in a safe way is this: Most of your XCH is stored in a cold wallet. You then have an accessible wallet (also known as a *hot wallet*) where you store a little bit of XCH for spending as you need it.

### Social Engineering and Phishing
Remember, don't trust anyone or anything online. A website may look legitimate, but are you sure? 
* Verify the website you are on is `chia.net` and make sure there is a lock icon in the address bar.

### Remove Remote Access Tools

### Device Encryption
Encryption is one of the best tools in your arsenal. Encrypting
