We are excited to announce that today our new Bug Bounty program has gone live with the support of [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com)!

This program is initially rolling out to a curated list of select security researchers managed by Bugcrowd while we iron out any kinks and get the program up to full speed. After that, Bugcrowd will be inviting more researchers to the program in waves over the next few weeks, with the goal of opening up the Bounty program to their entire network of millions of security researchers, before the end of the year.

If you are a security researcher who is passionate about blockchain technology and the work we do here at Chia, we encourage you to sign up and join their program (assuming you already aren't part of it!) and join in as soon as you are able in one of their waves. It's not often I am *excited* about spending large sums of money, but paying out security researchers for quality findings is definitely one of those reasons!

(When the time comes that we're able to fully open to program to all members of the Bugcrowd platform at large, we'll be sure to update everyone again at that time!)
