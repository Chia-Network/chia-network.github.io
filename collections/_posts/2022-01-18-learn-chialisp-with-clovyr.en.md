_[Update below](#reg-dates) with dates and registration._

Since the launch of mainnet last year, we at Chia have been working hard to increase the adoption of the Chia blockchain. We’ve focused our energy on building reference implementations like the [Pool Reference](https://github.com/Chia-Network/pool-reference), Chialisp standards such as [CAT1](https://www.chia.net/2021/11/15/the-CATs-out-of-the-bag.en.html), and support for DEXes with [Offers](https://www.chia.net/2022/01/12/chia-offers-are-here-en.html). In these efforts, the Chia team has led the development charge, but it has always been our goal to build a strong developer community that can bring new and exciting innovations of their own to Chia. To support this goal we are investing in developer tools, [training materials](https://www.chia.net/2021/12/17/announcing-our-new-documentation-site.en.html), and programs to support our growing developer ecosystem. 

Today we are announcing a partnership with [Clovyr](https://clovyr.app) as well as the first Developer Challenge. 

## About Clovyr

Clovyr makes alternatives to data-hungry SaaS applications. Whether people choose to run a blog, a chat server for friends, or self-custody a node, Clovyr makes it easy for anyone to run apps and services on any host and access them privately from any web browser. The platform is privacy-preserving in novel and meaningful ways: once launched, no usage data from any apps in a user's library are passed through Clovyr's infrastructure. 

Clovyr Code is a full-featured VSCode instance accessible via the browser. Unlike other remote development environments, Clovyr Code offers a fully-functional terminal running on a private VPS accessible only to the user. The current beta on [clovyr.app/code](https://clovyr.app/code/) offers one-click environments for many popular programming languages like JavaScript and Rust. 

Today, the Clovyr and Chia teams are releasing a new environment for the Clovyr Code beta which is tailor-made for Chialisp developers. Pre-built with all the necessary command-line tools and even a pre-synced full node on the Chia testnet, we're reducing the time to get building on Chia without sacrificing the power of a completely customizable developer environment.

## Developer Challenge
To help celebrate this partnership, we are announcing a Developer Challenge event, focusing on development that leverages the Clovyr Code development environment for Chia. This developer challenge will be an online event where developers will compete to create innovative solutions using the Chia blockchain and Chialisp on Clovyr’s development tools. Winners of the 24-hour challenge will be awarded prizes in the form of crypto or fiat funds, at their discretion. This first Developer Challenge’s registration will open on Thursday, January 20th along with further details and a breakdown of the prize structure. The specific objectives and judging criteria will be announced when the challenge kicks off during the first week of February 2022.

To begin preparing for the Developer Challenge, begin learning [Chialisp](https://chialisp.com/) and explore the [Clovyr chia environment](https://clovyr.app/instant/code-chia) today!

The challenge will last through the 24 hour window until time is up at 12-noon PST the following day, February 4th. Chia Network engineers will be on-hand in Keybase to provide Chialisp support and guidance during that 24 hour window, to help answer questions and provide guidance.

In the days following the event, we will announce a grand prize winner of $10,000, a runner up of $5,000 and a 3rd place prize of $2,500 payable via Crypto or Fiat (USD) at your preference.
