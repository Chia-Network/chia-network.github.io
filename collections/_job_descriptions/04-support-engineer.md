Chia Network is looking for a Support Engineer who shares our vision of enabling the blockchain community to farm Chia and grow the network. To that end, a critical component of our ecosystem is supporting Chia Pools and the development of Chia Asset Tokens (more commonly known as CATs). 

As Support Engineer, you will work with Chia’s Ecosystem team and our amazing Engineering team to provide support and guidance to independent pool operators and CAT creators. Working with our engineers and technical writers, you will help create both reference code as well as troubleshoot and provide one-on-one guidance to Pool Operators on how to implement new features and functionality into their pools, as we roll them out. In this position, you will be the vanguard between the independent community of Pool Operators & CATs developers, and Chia Network, not only supporting them but also surfacing their feedback and pain points back to Chia for improvement.

This is an exciting and important role to get your foot in the door of Chia’s engineering team. You will have the rare opportunity to work with some of the best engineers and cryptographers in the business to help shape the future of Chia, and unlock the very best experiences for our diverse community of Pool Operators and CATs developers.

**Ideally, you have:**

* Experience with Python, Rust, C++, Java, GO or other programming languages and frameworks
* Experience as a self motivated and relentless problem solver.
* Understanding of and some experience with cryptographic concepts
* Knowledge of Blockchain technologies like wallets, nodes, UTXO, smart contracts, proof of work, proof of stake and consensus algorithms. (Experience with pooling systems a solid bonus!)
* An understanding of the advantages of open source software and open source communities
* Experience engaging in communications with developer communities and technical-level support conversations
* Excellent communication skills required
* A passion for troubleshooting and support with a knack for making complex topics and ideas easy to understand by fellow developers

**Bonus points if you:**

* Have knowledge, skills or experience with crypto pooling protocols and systems on other blockchain technologies (extra bonus points if you have experiencing working on a Chia pool!)
* Prior experience with a technical and developer-focused community
* Currently are a farmer of Chia and/or community developer in the Chia ecosystem


**In this role, you will:**

* Quickly learn Chia’s fundamental technologies as well as Chialisp, and use that knowledge to help others solve problems with their own implementations
* Provide one-on-one and small group technical support to our community of Pool Operators in supporting their implementation of our pooling protocol
* Work with our technical writers and engineers to provide up to date community feedback, code examples, and other documentation as needed
