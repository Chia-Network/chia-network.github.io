We're looking for people to code the underlying infrastructure for the future financial system on Chia using Chialisp (information on [chialisp.com](https://chialisp.com)â€“don't worry if you don't have any experience with it yet, nobody else does either.) 

**Perks**

Chia Network Inc. allows for flexible work hours and remote work for this position. Core hours can be flexible based on your location within reason to ensure a minimal functional overlap with United States working hours. We offer competitive salaries and, if you are in the United States, a comprehensive benefits package including medical, dental, and life insurance for you, your spouse/domestic partner and children.

**Application Process**

If you want to apply, code something in Chialisp, put it on the web, and send links to that along with your Keybase handle and CV/resume (if you have any) to jobs@chia.net
