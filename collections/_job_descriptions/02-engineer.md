Chia Networks is hiring several technically gifted programmers to expand our team of cryptographers and engineers building our protocol with a focus on easy to use software across architectures and operating systems. You should have strong algorithms skills. Cryptography experience is a plus but not required. Remote is okay and currently the standard though there is a concentration of people in the SF Bay Area. To apply please complete a couple [LeetCode Contests](https://leetcode.com/contest/) and send a link to your LeetCode profile plus your resume in your Cover Letter.

We once asked Bram what to put here and he said, "We need engineers to press buttons on computers..."
