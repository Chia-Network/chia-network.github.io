title: "Will the average person be able to use Chia as a payment instrument?"
---

Our hope is that Chia will be supported by point of sale systems and consumer payment apps all over the world. For example, if you pay for a coffee at Tully's in England with your GrabPay app from Thailand, it should "just work" without you needing to know it was paid in Chia.

Or, for example, if services like Venmo or Cash App aren't available where you live, using Chia will be far less of a hassle than executing a slow and expensive wire transfer. Using legacy banking to send and convert cash across borders is cumbersome, slow and expensive, and while alternative money transfer services might be faster, they’re not cheap: Western Union can charge upwards of 10% in transfer fees.

The technology will be completely open source and accessible, and anyone will be able to build a new wallet without our permission. We will help wallet, exchange, and merchant processing partners with support and integration services, joint marketing and lending for liquidity.
