title: "Where can I learn more about the technical details of your consensus algorithm?"
---

We have academic papers and presentations that give detail about our new consensus algorithm and blockchain software.
In 2019 we revealed our [Green Paper](https://www.chia.net/assets/ChiaGreenPaper.pdf) outlining the construction of Proofs of Space and Time and illustrating many of the design choices of Chia.

We have updated our consensus algorithm and you can review and commment on our [working document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tmRIb7lgi4QfKkNaxuKOBHRmwbVlGL4f7EsBDr_5xZE/edit).

There is also a [2019 talk from Mariano Sorgente](https://youtu.be/_075bzQPooU) at MIT on how to achieve Nakamoto consensus with Proof of Space and VDFs.

Bram Cohen [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zlcgt8FVz4) at Stanford on February 2018 on Proofs of Space. Our advisors, Dan Boneh, Benedikt Bünz, and Ben Fisch [published a survey of VDFs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/712.pdf) which are the underlying technology of Proof of Time.
Lipa Long [published an explanation of class groups](https://github.com/Chia-Network/vdf-competition/blob/master/classgroups.pdf) that our [Proofs of Time](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/627.pdf) is based on. Bram presented [Beyond Hellman’s Time-Memory Trade-Offs with Applications to Proofs of Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqxkO7C-cyk) at BPASE '18 in January 2018 based on the [academic paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/893) and these [slides](https://view.publitas.com/chia-network/pbase18slides/page/1) by Hamza Abusalah. Ben Fisch gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUoagL7OZ1k&feature=youtu.be) at BPASE 2018 in January 2018 on Verifiable Delay Functions. Bram [spoke at Blockchain at Berkeley](https://www.facebook.com/BlockchainatBerkeley/videos/2006069823011271/) (which starts about 20:00) in March 2018 with [slides](https://cyber.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj9936/f/bramcohen.pdf). Bram gave a [talk at BPASE 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYG0NxoG7yw) in January 2017 on removing waste with Proofs of Space and Time ([slides](https://cyber.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj9936/f/bramcohen.pdf)).

Bram gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZaB4hM8SQ4) at SF Bitcoin Devs Seminar about data structures for scaling Bitcoin with [slides](https://view.publitas.com/chia-network/bitcoin_data_structures/) and [Merkle Set code](https://github.com/bramcohen/MerkleSet). Bram gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZaB4hM8SQ4) at SF Bitcoin Devs Seminar about removing waste from cryptocurrencies.
