title: "What are the rules and guidelines around using Chia's Trademarks and Copyrighted Materials on my own site or project?"
---

Chia, like all companies, has an obligation to protect and enforce its Trademarks and Copyrights in the relevant jurisdictions. We do this both to ensure that we properly maintain our own responsible use of them, as well as to prevent bad actors from attempting to leverage Chia's property in an effort to scam the ecosystem or cause other harm. That said, we do want to make it possible for people to talk about Chia, and build tools and platforms that support it's growth openly. To this effect [we have several guidelines](/about#legal) that we hope will help you better understand some "Do's and Don'ts" as you go about this. (And if you are ever unsure, you are always welcome to email us at [hello@chia.net](mailto:hello@chia.net) with questions about this subject!)
