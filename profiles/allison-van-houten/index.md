Allison Van Houten is the CMO at Chia Network, which powers global financial access and ownership through the most secure, sustainable and compliant public blockchain. She is a go-to-market leader who makes it easy for millions of people to understand and adopt new products and categories, especially by crafting brand stories from awareness through retention. As a result, the global teams she’s quickly scaled have driven revenue growth, bolstered brand strength, and established efficient operations at venture-backed consumer tech and media companies like Epic! For Kids (acquired by BYJU’S), Getaround, and Omada Health. She has also built brands and launched new products at publicly traded companies, including Google, YouTube and Martha Stewart.
