Ali Shadle is the Vice President of Operations at Chia Network. Prior to Chia, Ali was an early  product manager at the unicorn Honey that recently sold to PayPal for $4B. With over 10 years of experience in tech, she has also conducted research under Evan Reas and Dr. Anders Ericsson. Dr. Ericsson discovered the 10,000 hour rule popularized by Malcolm Gladwell. While conducting her research, Ali interviewed 30+ hedge fund managers and more than 50 venture capitalists. This led her to develop hedge fund strategy based on the hypothesis of predicting "coaching trees" (similar to the PayPal Mafia), predicting from which groups originate the most successful founders, CEO's or executives who are most likely to consistently outperform their peers.
