                    <h1>Sustainable and secure Circular Drive Initiative</h1>
                    <p>As a founding member of the Circular Drive Initiative, we join William McDonough and the computer hardware industry in our commitment to reduce e-waste by enabling the secure reuse of storage devices. We support the opportunity to securely reduce e-waste by giving hard disk and solid-state drives a second life via Chia farming, the process of earning rewards for validating transactions in the Chia network. The Chia netspace amounts to over 40 exabytes, with over 350,000 nodes to date.</p>

                <h3>Secure</h3>
                <p>Chia is the most decentralized blockchain ever with approximately 350,000 nodes employing the first new Nakamoto Consensus since 2009. The Chialisp on-chain programming environment is fully featured while being far more auditable, and secure.</p>

                <h3>Compliant</h3>
                <p>Chia believes that in order to deliver on the promise of the next generation of blockchains, we must be regulatory compliant. It is our stated goal to become a public reporting company subject to the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_Act_of_1933">Securities Act of 1933</a>. Chia's native currency, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/chia">XCH or chia</a>, has never been sold by Chia Network for fiat currency, and we believe it will be regulated as a commodity by the <a href = "https://www.cftc.gov/">CFTC</a>.</p>

                <p>With its innovative Proof Of Space and Time consensus, Chia uses 0.16% of the <a href="https://chiapower.org">annual energy consumption</a> of Bitcoin, and 0.36% of Ethereum's. Chia is part of the <a href="https://circulardrives.org/">Circular Drive Initiative</a> that reduces e-waste through the secure reuse of storage devices, promoting the second use of hard drives for Chia farming.</p>
