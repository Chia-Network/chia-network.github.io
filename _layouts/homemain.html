                <h3>Compliant</h3>
                <p>Chia believes that in order to deliver on the promise of the next generation blockchains, we must be regulatory compliant. It is our stated goal to become a public reporting company subject to the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_Act_of_1933">Securities Act of 1933</a>. Chia's native currency, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/chia">XCH or chia</a>, has never been sold by Chia Network for money and we believe it will be regulated as a commodity by the <a href = "https://www.cftc.gov/">CFTC</a>.</p>
