                <p>
                    The business whitepaper outlines how we plan to go to market, how we plan to use the corporate form to do that, and how we intend to use our pre-farm. It also explains the tokenomics of Chia coins and walks through the controls we are putting in place to assure that the pre-farm is a secure and predictable tool that we will use to finance development and growth and ultimately give everyone a chance to own part of the pre-farm. Our plans and structure are unique and touch on a lot of different areas of expertise including enterprise software sales, blockchain project governance, and securities laws that we must navigate to have the resources needed to drive the adoption of the Chia blockchain into the world's financial infrastructure.
