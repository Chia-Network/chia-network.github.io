               Through our partnership with Stably and Prime Trust you can now use an audited and fully backed stablecoin to acquire XCH in a trustless and peer-to-peer way using <a href="/offers">Offers</a>. It is also cheaper and more secure than a centralized exchange.

            </p>

            <h4>1. Open a <a href="https://www.stably.io/stably-prime/" target="_blank">Stably Prime Trust</a> account</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Sign up for a <a href="https://prime.stably.io/user/signup" target="_blank">Stably account</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You will need to provide your name, email address, phone number
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h4>2. Fund your Stably account by depositing USD to your Stably Prime account</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Go through Stably’s Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process to complete setting up your account (this is usually instant but may take up to a day or two to complete ). After the KYC process has completed, you can initiate a “Deposit” by transferring from a traditional bank through ACH or a domestic or international wire transfer. Credit and debit cards are coming soon.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h4>3. Withdraw USDS directly to your Chia light wallet</h4>

                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.chia.net/download/#light-wallet-beta" target="_blank">Download</a> and install the Chia Light wallet
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the Light Wallet go to <em>+Add Token</em> and select "Stably USD"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From your Stably USD account, click on <em>Withdraw</em> → <em>Stablecoins</em> → <em>USDS</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add your USDS Chia wallet in Stably and then specify the amount of USDS to complete your withdrawal
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <h4>4. Post or redeem an offer to trade USDS for XCH</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Post an offer or monitor the offers being posted at <a href="https://keybase.io/team/chia_offers" target="_blank">Keybase - chia_offers</a>, <a href="https://hash.green/dex" target="_blank">Hashgreen</a>, <a href="https://offerbin.io/" target="_blank">Offerbin</a>, or <a href="https://offerpool.io/" target="_blank">Offerpool</a>.
